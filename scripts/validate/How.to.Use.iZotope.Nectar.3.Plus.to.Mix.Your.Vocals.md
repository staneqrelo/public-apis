## What is iZotope Nectar 3 Plus?
 
iZotope Nectar 3 Plus is a vocal mixing plug-in that offers a comprehensive set of tools to enhance your vocal production. It includes modules for pitch correction, breath control, gate, EQ, compression, de-esser, saturation, reverb, delay, harmony, and dimension. You can use these modules individually or in combination to create custom vocal chains for different styles and genres.
 
Nectar 3 Plus also features an intelligent Vocal Assistant that can analyze your vocal tracks and suggest optimal settings for each module based on your desired outcome. You can choose from three modes: Vintage, Modern, or Dialogue. You can also adjust the intensity and target of the Vocal Assistant to fine-tune the results.
 
Another feature of Nectar 3 Plus is the Unmask function, which helps you make your vocals stand out in a busy mix. Unmask detects and reduces any frequencies that might be masking your vocals from other instruments in your mix. You can use Unmask with any track that has Relay on it, which is a lightweight plug-in that allows you to control the gain, pan, width, and tone of any track in relation to your vocals.
 
## How to Use iZotope Nectar 3 Plus to Mix Your Vocals
 
To use iZotope Nectar 3 Plus to mix your vocals, you need to first load it as a plug-in on your vocal track in your DAW. Then, you can follow these steps:
 
1. Use the Vocal Assistant to get a starting point for your vocal chain. Click on the Vocal Assistant button and choose your mode (Vintage, Modern, or Dialogue). Then, choose your intensity (Light, Moderate, or Aggressive) and target (Balanced or Upfront). Finally, click Next and play back your vocal track. The Vocal Assistant will analyze your vocals and apply the appropriate settings for each module.
2. Review and tweak the settings suggested by the Vocal Assistant. You can turn on or off any module by clicking on its name. You can also adjust the parameters of each module by clicking on its icon. For example, you can change the amount of pitch correction, the shape of the EQ curve, the type of compression, or the style of reverb.
3. Add any additional modules or effects that you want to use. You can drag and drop any module from the left panel to the right panel to add it to your vocal chain. You can also reorder or delete any module by dragging it up or down or clicking on the X button. For example, you can add a harmony module to create vocal harmonies, a delay module to create echo effects, or a dimension module to create chorus or flanger effects.
4. Use the Unmask function to make your vocals cut through the mix. Click on the Unmask button and select any track that has Relay on it from the drop-down menu. The Unmask function will automatically adjust the EQ of both tracks to reduce any masking frequencies. You can also adjust the amount of unmasking by using the slider below the button.
5. Use Relay to control the dynamics and balance of your vocals in relation to other instruments in your mix. Load Relay as a plug-in on any track that you want to compare with your vocals. Then, use the gain knob to adjust the level of that track relative to your vocals. You can also use the pan knob to adjust the stereo position of that track relative to your vocals. You can also use the width knob to adjust the stereo width of 0f148eb4a0
