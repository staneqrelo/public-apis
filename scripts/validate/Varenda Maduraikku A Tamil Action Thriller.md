Varenda Maduraikku is a remake of the Telugu blockbuster Okkadu, which starred Mahesh Babu and Bhumika Chawla. The movie follows the same plot and scenes as the original, with some minor changes to suit the Tamil audience. The movie is a typical masala entertainer that has action, romance, comedy and drama in equal proportions.
 
The movie begins with a flashback where a young boy named Arjun (Arjun Sarja) saves a girl named Meera (Haripriya) from a group of goons. He falls in love with her at first sight, but she disappears from his life. Years later, he becomes a police officer and is assigned to protect Madurai city from a terrorist group led by Obul Reddy (Ashish Vidyarthi), who is also a ruthless politician. Obul Reddy has a personal vendetta against Arjun, as he had killed his brother in an encounter.
 
One day, Arjun meets Meera again at a temple festival and rescues her from Obul Reddy's men, who are trying to kidnap her. He learns that Meera is engaged to Obul Reddy against her will and that her father (Suresh Gopi) is a helpless police officer who is under Obul Reddy's control. Arjun decides to help Meera escape from Obul Reddy's clutches and takes her to his home in Chennai. There, he faces many challenges from Obul Reddy's henchmen, his own family and Meera's father, who are all trying to separate them. How Arjun manages to save Meera and himself from Obul Reddy's wrath forms the rest of the story.
