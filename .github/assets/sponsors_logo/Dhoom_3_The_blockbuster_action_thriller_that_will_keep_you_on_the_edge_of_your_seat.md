Dhoom 3 also features Katrina Kaif as Aaliya, Sahir's love interest and circus partner, who dazzles with her dance moves and acrobatic skills. Kaif does not have much to do in terms of acting, but she shares a good chemistry with Khan and adds glamour to the film. Uday Chopra reprises his role as Ali, the comic relief and sidekick to Jai Dixit. Chopra's antics are mostly silly and repetitive, but he occasionally manages to elicit a chuckle.

The choreography by Vaibhavi Merchant and Shiamak Davar is spectacular and inventive, especially in the circus sequences. The cinematography by Sudeep Chatterjee is stunning and captures the beauty and grandeur of Chicago and its landmarks. The editing by Ritesh Soni is crisp and smooth, keeping the film at a tight length of 172 minutes.
 
The highlight of Dhoom 3, however, is the action sequences, designed by Conrad Palmisano and Sham Kaushal. The film boasts of some jaw-dropping stunts and chases, involving motorcycles, cars, helicopters, boats and even planes. The use of CGI is seamless and impressive, creating a realistic and thrilling experience. The film also makes good use of 3D technology, enhancing the depth and impact of the visuals.
