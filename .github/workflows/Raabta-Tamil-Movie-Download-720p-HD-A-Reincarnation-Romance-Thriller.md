## Raabta Movie Review - A Disappointing Rehash of a Familiar Theme
  
Raabta movie review: Raabta is a movie that tries to explore the idea of soulmates and reincarnation, but fails to deliver a convincing or engaging story. The movie borrows heavily from other movies like Magadheera, Mirzya and Baahubali, but lacks the originality and creativity that made those movies successful. The movie also suffers from poor editing, inconsistent tone and weak characterization.
  
The movie starts off as a light-hearted romance between Shiv and Saira, who meet in Budapest and feel an instant attraction. However, their relationship is soon tested by the arrival of Zakir (Jim Sarbh), a wealthy businessman who claims to be Saira's lover from a previous life. Zakir kidnaps Saira and takes her to an island, where he reveals their past as warriors who were killed by Shiv's ancestor. Shiv follows them and tries to rescue Saira, while also remembering his own past.
  
The movie switches between the present and the past, but fails to create any emotional impact or suspense. The past-life story is dull and predictable, with cliched dialogues and costumes. The present-day story is also superficial and unrealistic, with no depth or logic. The movie relies on coincidences and conveniences to move the plot forward, without any explanation or justification. The movie also has several unnecessary scenes and songs that drag the pace and add nothing to the story.
  
The movie wastes the talent of its lead actors, who try their best to salvage the script. Sushant Singh Rajput is a fine actor, but his character Shiv is annoying and arrogant. He does not have the charm or charisma to make us root for him or his love. Kriti Sanon is beautiful and expressive, but her character Saira is bland and passive. She does not have any agency or personality of her own. Jim Sarbh is menacing and impressive, but his character Zakir is one-dimensional and cartoonish. He does not have any motive or backstory for his obsession with Saira.
  
The movie has some redeeming factors, such as the cinematography by Martin Preiss, who captures the scenic beauty of Budapest and Mauritius. The music by Pritam is also catchy and melodious, especially the title track sung by Arijit Singh and Nikhita Gandhi. The movie also has some humorous moments, such as the cameo by Rajkummar Rao as a 324-year-old man.
  
However, these factors are not enough to save the movie from being a disappointing rehash of a familiar theme. Raabta is a movie that could have been much better if it had focused on developing its characters and story, rather than relying on gimmicks and cliches. Raabta is a movie that you can skip without missing anything.
